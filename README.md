# Hi, I’m Chris 👋

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub! I’m all about making cool, quirky projects — mostly games and web stuff that’s a bit fun, a bit chaotic in programming but still make it work. 🚀

## Projects

- **[Cat Clicker: PURRstige Edition™](https://github.com/justdev-chris/Ultimate-Cat-Clicker)**  
  A pixel-art idle clicker loaded with adventure, monsters, upgrades, and some seriously quirky lore.  

- **[VibeCheck.ai](https://github.com/justdev-chris/Pixel-ArcadeV5)**  
  A project I made with a proxy, movies, and games. Didn't really go out that much. 


*(More cool projects brewing...)*

## Fun Fact

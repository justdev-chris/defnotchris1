# Hi, I’m Chris 👋

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub! I’m all about making cool, quirky projects — mostly games and web stuff that’s a bit fun, a bit chaotic, and full of personality. 🚀

## About Me

- 🔭 Currently working on: **Cat Clicker: PURRstige Edition™** and other wild web games  
- 🌱 Always learning new tricks in JavaScript, Node.js, game dev, and how to bring my random ideas to life  
- 👾 Big fan of pixel art vibes and indie games that don’t take themselves too seriously  
- 🎨 Love to doodle and create, sometimes with a touch of weirdness (ask me about that sometime...)  
- 💬 Down to talk code, games, or just whatever’s on your mind

## Fun Fact

> I mix gaming and coding like peanut butter and jelly — messy but somehow it works.
